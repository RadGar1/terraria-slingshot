Slingshot Mod adds a new ranged subclass: Slingshots. They use different types of rocks and stone as ammo so go mining and get all those rocks. I tried to make it so it is a full subclass so many things that guns and bows have, slingshots will have an equivalent. Things like a new shroomite helmet and slingshot accessories. 
The goal is for this mod to be indistinguishable from the base game. That means the slingshots shouldn't be too powerful like some weapons are in other mods but hopefully they are still interesting. It also means there is at least one slingshot for major stage of progression so you can do a full slingshot playthrough if you choose. 
This is a work in progress so many of the non-slingshot elements are unfinished.
